 In this we are going to implement the our project called multi module commute

We had performed various observations, we made a log book in which we wrote something about new things that we observed in day to day life, which is root cause of developing new ideas. We found some solution that could tackle the current problems. We did some more research on the topic we selected that is “Multi Module Commute” and we derived an appropriate solution for it. We have used different web application like “makemytrip, yatra, goibibo etc..” and observed activities and found some problems. We have tried to solve them in our project. In short, it’s a step ahead to digital India. 


Our domain is “Travel Apps”. Today people use more online resource to book or buy different things. At this time the most popular apps are travel app like makemytrip, Goibibo, trivago, yatra.com,etc. We have selected this domain because generally such apps have more problems. 

For example, we use those app to book different tickets for the train, bus, taxi, flights,etc. But in that app, there is no such options to book all the method in one booking. Moreover, it does not provide proper resources which are needed on booking time.     

So, we used those app and found out the different problems and we are trying to solve those problem in our Design Engineering Project.
